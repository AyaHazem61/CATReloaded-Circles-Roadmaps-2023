Here you have the main topics and for each one there are some suggested courses .
> Notice that any roadmap is not sacred, you may find some courses better than the suggested ones from your perspective and that's completely okay, however, you should go through all the topics.
So let's start

### C Programming
**Topics covered:** 
`what is C` `formatted input/output` `conditions and loops` `data types`  `functions` `arrays` `pointers` `strings` `structures` `unions and enums` 

studying these topics from :-
  [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR)      ( recommended && Free  course )

Or 

[Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/microcontroller-embedded-c-programming/)         (great course but  paid)

**Note :**
'beside any of these 2 courses you should study the same topics from this book for better outcome'

[C Programming: A Modern Approach by K N King](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18pLjNvcf7OJhg01fVJITXdvKFAuemAuF/view?fbclid=IwAR0z59u7lvfRmpgWF45GDmn38kVd0uNycTvE511CuYRbMVq1Jv72rc7wYIg)

        
### Advanced C
learning more about pointers & core techniques for memory management using pointers.

we will study these topics from :-

[Understanding and Using C Pointers: Core Techniques for Memory Management by Richard M. Reese](https://b-ok.africa/book/2074711/cf387f)
                                           

                   
### Introduction to Git and GitHub
studying it from :

[Git and GitHub | شخبط وانت متطمن](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6G-J54vgKc&t=7346s&ab_channel=%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8ABigData)           
                            


             Then  doing a large-scale project covered all studied topics 

### Data Structure
Here we will go to learn the basic data structures like: stacks, queues, lists, and trees. Also we will learn how to implement them in C.

we will study these topics from :-
CS214: Data Structures
we will find the course assignments here and the book here                             
                                                     It will take 5 week
         We will take an online Exam
### Algorithm 
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth.

Topics covered:"big-oh" notation asymptotic analysis , Divide-and-conquer basics , QuickSort , Linear-time selection 
we will study these topics from :-
1- Intro to Algorithm :
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIHnBIU7Birg7x868_ucmUcy6ohMCgMxM
2- Stanford course at coursera
https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer?specialization=algorithms#syllabus
                                                  It will take 5 weeks
Then  We will do a large-scale project and interview for the level 

# Intermediate Level
### MCU Architecture 
- processor execution steps(fetch,decode,Execute)
- MCU fundamental
- (os vs    Bare Metal , Mcu memory types,Van Neumann vs   Harvard, Cisc vs Risc) .
- MCU Clocks(clock source). 
###  MCU interfacing 
- Offline sessions 
- NTI course 
- [Embedded C - Atmel Studio - YouTube](link)
### **Important notes**
   - The main reference during this stage should  be from DataSheet 
   - You can also check this book 
  [AVR MAZIDI](link)
Starting from chapter 7
<h3 align="center">A large-scale project. It would take 3 months.</h3>
